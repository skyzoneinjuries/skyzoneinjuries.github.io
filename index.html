                        <p class="lead">The following are excerpts from a Wikipedia entry on the company Sky Zone that operates trampoline parks.</p>
                        </a>
                        <p class="blockquote">“In 2017, a three-year-old suffered a broken bone at a "toddler time" jump activity offered by a Florida Sky Zone after an impact with a mat, despite a 2015 statement by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons that children under six should not be allowed to use trampolines, due to safety concerns.”<br><br>
                            “A news investigation revealed a pattern of recurring injuries at Sky Zone parks, including broken bones. These injuries, the investigation found, were caused by people getting their feet caught in the trampolines' metal frame or by being fallen on by others. A lawsuit connected to this investigation alleges dangerous design flaws, and points to internal Sky Zone worker manuals that warn about the pads, a warning reportedly not given to customers.”<br><br>
                            “Adults have also been part of these patterns of injuries. Joba Chamberlain, former New York Yankees pitcher, suffered from extreme blood loss after breaking his ankle at a Sky Zone park in 2012.”

                            <p class="blockquote">“Investigative Reporter Eric Rasmussen uncovered videos and internal records from Sky Zone that lawyers say reveal hidden dangers and raise questions about whether the company is doing enough to keep customers safe.<br><br>
                                “The attitude toward the injuries prior to our [client’s] accident shows me a cavalier disregard for the danger,” said Marty Rosenthal, lawyer for 17-year old Owen Mooney who broke his tibia and fibula while jumping at Sky Zone Boston in 2011. “From our point of view, it's more than a broken leg case. It's four surgeries, a year out of his life, it's some permanent impairment and it's pretty willful or reckless indifference to this hazardous design.”<br><br>
                                “Sky Zone’s own incident reports highlight the problem. In report after report, customersdescribe injuries involving either trampoline mats or the protective pads around the metalframe. Mats and pads appear to be of concern for Sky Zone too. An employee manual obtained by 25 Investigates warns workers to “BE AWARE OF THE PADS.”

                            "A little girl just popped her shoulder out of place. Can I get an ambulance, please?" a manager asked the 911 dispatcher.<br><br>
                            Two weeks later, a 19-year-old man reportedly suffered a similar injury.<br><br>
                            "I just had someone jump into the foam, possibly dislocated his shoulder," said the employee.<br><br>
                            At Sky Zone Space Coast in Rockledge, an 11-year-old boy was screaming as he awaited paramedics to treat his knee injury.<br><br>
                            "He was just bouncing, and we tried to get him up and he's just not getting up," the employee told dispatchers.</p>

We were completely shocked to hear this. We had no idea," Hill said. "My husband and I would have never put our baby boy on a trampoline if we would have known that beforehand."<br><br>
                            She said that they were especially shocked because the trampoline park they went to "specifically advertises for small children. They advertise for toddler time." She said that she signed a waiver before they started jumping but she cannot recall its terms.<br><br>
                            Skyzone Tampa did not respond when asked whether it plans to continue its trampoline times for toddlers.</p>

                                “Doctors found that there was a large amount of internal bleeding in my body … The doctor told my husband to be mentally prepared as there was a 20 per cent chance that I might die.  The doctor said he had never seen someone with such a severe injury in 10 years and what he retrieved from my body was pieces of my kidney.” 
                                
                                Lee also presented a letter from Queen Mary Hospital as proof that she had undergone a nephrectomy, an operation to remove an entire kidney.</p>

                                    A 6abc Action News investigation uncovered hundreds of dispatch calls to trampoline parks in our area over three years. As these parks explode in popularity, critics say some customers are jumping straight into the ER, and the parks need to be regulated. A fractured ankle during trampoline dodge-ball, a broken neck flipping into the foam pit, a severed foot, and a teen who suffered a severe brain injury after falling through a hole in a trampoline are just some of the injuries Action News found.

                                    In a hidden-camera investigation, reporters posing as customers found that many trampoline-park operators routinely cut corners on safety—foam pits were far too shallow, padding around springs and frames was minimal, and exposed hardware remained unguarded. Staff levels were insufficient to enforce basic rules, and parks leaned heavily on liability waivers rather than upgrading equipment or training employees.
